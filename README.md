# Windows-10-Privacy-Blocklist
Experimental blocklist for Windows 10.

This is a custom-made, highly experimental blocklist for Windows 10 with the goal of increasing privacy and minimizing data collection by Microsoft when using the Windows 10 operating system. 

This list is/will be made up of domains from popular Windows 10 privacy apps and Microsoft's own documentation.

# What's included in this list?

This list is a compilation of various sources and methods.

1) Using official Mcirosoft documentation on Windows 10 endpoints. 
2) Domains blocked by Windows 10 Privacy apps like DWS, SU10, and WDP.
3) Additional domains found on other Windows 10 blocklists.

# What's not included in this list?

That's the million dollar question. Windows 10 is closed source, so we can never really know exactly what's going on under the hood, but this is a start.

However, two immediate areas of improvement come to mind for this list. The first is that the official Windows 10 documenatation is done by monitoring IPv4 traffic, meaning there could be traffic over IPv6 that we are unaware of. The second would be simply looking at all traffic over Wireshark on a fresh install of Windows 10. I simply don't have the technical knowledge or time to do so myself. The vast majority of it is likely in this list already, but you never know.

# DO NOT USE THIS LIST UNTIL OTHERWISE NOTIFIED. IT WILL LIKELY BREAK WINDOWS.
